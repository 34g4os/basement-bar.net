## How much MCT oil should I take a day to lose weight?
Even one tablespoon of MCT oil per day will help with weight loss. But for fastest results, Whittel recommends two to three tablespoons daily along with a diet that emphasizes healthy fats, protein, and veggies. (Save any healthy starch for your evening meal, when studies show you're best able to burn it off.)May 28, 2020

## How much MCT oil should I take to get into ketosis?
I typically recommend starting with 1 teaspoon and slowly increasing to 1 tablespoon. MCT oil can be taken 1 to 3 times per day to support ketosis. Note that higher doses may help you get into ketosis, but if weight loss is a goal, you want to encourage your body to use its own body fat as fuel.Dec 3, 2019

## How many milligrams of MCT oil should I take a day?
Although currently MCT oil doesn't have a defined tolerable upper intake level (UL), a maximum daily dose of 4–7 tablespoons (60–100 mL) has been suggested (38). While it's also not clear what dose is needed to obtain potential health benefits, most studies conducted have used between 1–5 tablespoons (15–74 mL) daily.

## How often should you take MCT oil?

MCT, or Medium Chain Triglycerides, are the primary fats found in coconut oil and are some of the healthiest and most beneficial fats found in nature. The benefits of taking MCT oil every day are so plentiful, there's no reason not to take it! It doesn't even taste bad!Nov 30, 2021

Weight gain: A tablespoon of MCT oil contains roughly 120 calories and 14 grams of fat. If you're adding it to your diet instead of using it as a replacement for other fat sources, the extra calories could result in extra pounds, Jones says.Nov 11, 2021

## How much MCT oil should I take for weight loss?
The range to aim for is 1-3 doses of MCT oil per day. Since each dose should be no more than one tablespoon, this means you should take no more than three tablespoons of MCT oil per day for fat loss.

## How many MCT oil pills should I take a day?
How Often Should You Take MCT Oil Softgels? To increase healthy fats and energy, take up to 3 – 6 servings per day. If you've never taken MCT oil before, we recommend starting with smaller, fewer servings and working your way up, as some people may experience stomach upset before their body gets adjusted to MCTs.

## Does MCT oil pills work?
MCTs have many potential health benefits, and taking MCT oil supplements may also be beneficial. While MCTs may not lead to dramatic weight loss, they may be able to play a role in overall weight management. They may also help boost energy and endurance, although more research is needed to prove this benefit.

## Is it OK to take MCT oil everyday?
MCT oil doesn't currently have a defined tolerable upper intake level (UL). But a maximum daily dose of 4 to 7 tablespoons (60–100 mL) has been suggested as a safe upper limit (47). MCTs are high in calories and usually only make up about 5–10% of your total calorie intake.

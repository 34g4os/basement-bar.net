## Do refrigerators need to be vented?
Without proper ventilation, you can damage the fridge and cause it to consume more energy. You'll need at least a quarter-inch gap for ventilation on the sides of the refrigerator as well as one inch on the back and top.

## Where is refrigerator air vent?
There are vents on the left side of the refrigerator that meet up with vents on the side of the icemaker casing on the door. The top vent supplies the icemaker compartment with cold air from the freezer when the door is closed. You may feel cold air coming from the top vent when the door is open.

Plan Proper Ventilation Refrigerators need to breathe. If they are entirely boxed in, then there's not much room for ventilation. When you measure the space for the refrigerator, and compare it to the size of the refrigerator, leave at least 1 inch of extra room for the back and the top of the refrigerator.

## What's wrong with sippy cups?
The amount of liquid a sippy cup can hold (often 12 ounces) is way too much for a toddler. Misusing a sippy cup can even make milk (which is normally a very healthy drink) contribute to cavities if your child carries around the sippy cup of milk all day or drinks milk after they brush their teeth at night.Mar 18, 2021

## Do pediatricians recommend sippy cups?
Some pediatricians favor using sippy cups during mealtimes only and never allowing them to become comfort objects. The limited scientific literature on the subject says sippy cups are fine if parents are in control of their use, which is a lot easier to do during meals.Jul 15, 2018

## Do sippy cups cause speech problems?
Sippy cups -- the often character-themed training cups that come with a snap-on lid and hard spout -- and/or thumb sucking can cause difficulty with articulation and clarity of speech in some children, says Sandra Holtzman, MS, a speech pathologist and certified orofacial myologist in Coconut Creek, Fla.Feb 12, 2008

## Why straws are better than sippy cups?
A straw cup will help to build lip, cheek, and tongue strength and will promote an appropriate resting position of the tongue for future speech development and a proper swallow pattern. A sippy cup on the other hand will encourage a forward tongue resting position, which often results in a frontal lingual lisp.Jul 15, 2016

## At what age should you introduce a sippy cup?

Fill it with the familiar. Your baby might take to her sippy cup more readily if it's filled with a familiar fluid, like breast milk or formula. Or, she may balk at her old favorite coming from a strange new source. In that case, try water or cow's milk (which you can introduce starting at 1 year).Feb 16, 2021

## How do you introduce formula to a sippy cup?
“The best way I've found to make this transition is by putting whatever baby drinks (expressed breast milk or formula) in the sippy cup and only putting water in their bottle,” Crews says. “This makes the sippy cup more desirable than the bottle.” However you choose to do it, stay consistent.

## Can I use a sippy cup instead of a bottle?

## When can I give my baby formula in a cup?

## How do you transition from bottle to sippy cup?
Weaning: The idea is to slowly swap out bottles in favor of cups. For example, you might fill in a cup for the bottle at just one feeding a day, then add a second cup the following week. No matter how slow (or fast) you want to go, Ayoob says you should take away the mid-day bottles first, then the morning one.Mar 31, 2022

## When should a baby use a sippy cup?
While most people don't think about it, you can introduce a straw cup or sippy cup as early as six months of age (or even earlier if you and baby will be apart for a feeding and baby is not interested in the bottle). However, most parents introduce a sippy cup or straw around 12 months of age.

## Is a straw or sippy cup better?
The spout in a sippy cup ultimately prohibits the tongue's range of motion similar to a traditional feeding bottle. The muscles used for drinking from a straw develop better swallowing patterns. Because of the specific placement of the straw in the mouth, there is a stronger development of oral motor skills.

## Is a sippy cup better than a bottle?
Around 12 months your child's swallow begins to mature and the continued used of a bottle or introduction of a hard-spouted sippy cup can interfere with progression from that infant suckle to a more mature swallow pattern. This is why we recommend ditching the bottle by 12 months of age and moving to a straw cup!May 2, 2018

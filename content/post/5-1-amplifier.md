The Bottom Line. 2.1, 5.1, and 7.1 channel speaker setups are options for home entertainment audio listening. 2.1is the best option for music-only listening and/or if you want a basic setup for upgrading your TV sound without a lot of speakers. 5.1 is the most common option for getting a home theater audio experience.Oct 23, 2020

## Is a home theater system good for music?
A home theater system can give you decent audio quality for music listening, but a stereo system will give you a less satisfactory experience for watching a movie.

## What do you need for a 5.1 surround system?
A 5.1 surround sound setup has two front speakers, a subwoofer, a center channel, and two surround speakers. With a 5.1 setup, you should place the surround speakers behind the listener at a 110-120-degree angle.Aug 16, 2020

Core Components. You'll need a 5.1 speaker set-up at the minimum to build a traditional surround sound home theater system.

## How can I use 5.1 speakers without a receiver?
All you need to do is connect the AUDIO OUT to the TV's HDMI port. After that, use the amplifier's output connection to connect it to the speaker.

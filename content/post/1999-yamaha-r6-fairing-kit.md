## What smells do mice hate?
Peppermint oil, cayenne pepper, pepper and cloves. Mice are said to hate the smell of these. Lightly soak some cotton balls in oils from one or more of these foods and leave the cotton balls in places where you've had problems with mice.Dec 20, 2013

## What smell do mice run away from?
Mice can be easily avoided around your household by simply adding the scent of peppermint in corners where they congregate. Yes, that's right, peppermint.Mar 21, 2022

## Is sleeping on a wedge good for you?

## Is sleeping with a wedge good for your back?
The bed wedge helps ease back pain that is commonly experienced, and provides extra support for the weight on your tummy. Back pain - propping the body up on a bed wedge removes pressure on the lumbar and cervical spine. It is good to note that the benefits are strongest when you sleep on your back.Jul 17, 2016

## What is the purpose of a bed wedge?
A bed wedge is a pillow used for sleeping that is made of moderately firm foam. The wedge pillow has a triangular shape with a tapered incline that helps the person using the pillow remain in a semi-upright position during sleep.Dec 21, 2015

## Is it healthy to sleep with a wedge?
Side sleepers who use a wedge pillow to sleep at an incline will also find relief for health issues like sleep apnea and acid reflux. Plus, using a wedge pillow for side sleep will offer greater support to your neck and shoulders, allowing your body to fall into the perfect neutral position.Nov 16, 2016

## What is a bed wedge good for?
These pillows use gravity to help acid drain into the stomach instead of staying in your throat. If you sleep with your head up at an angle, it may lead to fewer reflux symptoms. Keeping your head and shoulders at an angle also can help drain your sinuses.Apr 16, 2022

## How can I elevate my mattress?
A few ways to elevate your bed include sleeping on an adjustable bed, lying on a wedge pillow, or installing bed risers. Each method raises your upper body and controls the acid reflux.

## Can sleeping on a wedge hurt your back?
Sleepers with Back, Neck, or Shoulder Pain A wedge pillow can help promote proper spinal alignment and relieve pressure on the back, neck, and shoulders.

## How high should a wedge pillow be for back pain?
Use a mid-incline (7 to 9 inches) wedge pillow for back and side sleepers and to improve issues such as sleep apnea and acid reflux. Higher incline (10 inches or higher) wedge pillows work best when used for sitting upright.

## How can I raise my mattress for acid reflux?
For GERD treatment, place the risers only under the two legs at the top of your bed (the headboard end), not under the legs at the foot of your bed. The goal is to ensure that your head is higher than your feet. Raising the head of your bed by 6 inches can often have helpful results.

## How high should I elevate my bed for acid reflux?
Most studies suggest that the ideal height of bed head elevation is at least 6-8 inches (15-20 centimeters). This height is medically proven to prevent acid reflux when lying down. In actuality, the more elevation, the better.

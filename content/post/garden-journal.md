Plant Diary is a gardening app that helps gardeners manage their plants. The app allows gardeners to set alarms to remind themselves when to water their plants. Alarms can be set for multiple different plants in the garden.

## How do you plan a garden layout?
The most basic garden plan consists of a design with straight, long rows running north to south orientation. A north to south direction will ensure that the garden gets the best sun exposure and air circulation. A garden that runs east to west tends to get too shaded from the crops growing in the preceding row.Mar 25, 2021

## Can I design my garden on my phone?

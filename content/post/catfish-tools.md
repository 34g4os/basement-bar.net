## What kind of tackle for catfish?
A slip-sinker rig's a popular set-up given that catfish are often located near bottom. It's made by threading a sinker on the mainline, then a bead. Next, the mainline is tied to one end of a swivel. On the swivel's other end is a 1 to 2 foot monofilament leader, followed by the hook.

## What pound line should I use for catfish?
Catfish aren't line-shy, so you can use light or heavy fishing line as situations dictate. High-strength, small-diameter monofilaments testing 15 to 25 pounds are good inexpensive choices for all-round use, but when hunting the big boys, you may have to upgrade to 30-, 40-, even 80-pound-test.May 16, 2013

## What sinker is best for catfish?
The bell or bass-casting sinker sporting a swivel top has become one of the most popular sinkers among catfish anglers. It's a good multipurpose sinker to keep in the catbag for anchoring set rigs and for drifting. Bell sinkers anchor rigs better than egg sinkers do, but not quite as well as flat sinker designs.May 28, 2014

## What are catfish most attracted to?
Catfish are bottom feeders and are attracted to food by both sight and smell. They like bright colors such as orange or red. One of the best lures are Cheetos puffs. The bright orange color attracts their attention and the cheesy corn smell encourages them to bite.

## What equipment do you need to catch catfish?
A medium or medium light spinning rod can be used to catch small to medium-sized fish such as channel catfish. Aim for a medium heavy spinning rod for bigger fish. The rod should be at least seven feet long and have a rigid backbone with a reliable flex to help you reel in larger catfish.Jun 3, 2019

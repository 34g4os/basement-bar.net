## What do fairies do at Christmas?
How do fairies celebrate Noël? Fairies do not send Christmas cards. They muster all of their mental power into wishing someone good will. That energy becomes a beautiful bubble that sails into the breeze and toward the intended recipient.Dec 24, 2011

## Why do we have a fairy on the Christmas tree?
At first, a figure of the Baby Jesus was put on the top of the tree. Over time it changed into a star like the Wise Men saw or an angel/fairy that told the shepherds about Jesus.

## Is it a fairy or angel on Christmas tree?
A tree-topper or treetopper is a decorative ornament placed on the top (or "crown") of a Christmas tree. Tree-toppers can take any form, though the most common include a star (representing the Star of Bethlehem), finial, angel ("Christmas angel"), or fairy.

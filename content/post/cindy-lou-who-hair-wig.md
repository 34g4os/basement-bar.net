A wig is a type of hairpiece that is made to resemble natural hair. It is usually made of human hair, but it can also be made of synthetic fibers. Wigs are used to cover up baldness, hair loss, or thinning hair. They can also be used to change a person's hairstyle.

## Why does Martha may not have a Who nose?
She's the only adult in Whoville that doesn't have a snout like the rest of the adults which is probably because she either had plastic surgery or never got it when she went through puberty.

## Did Christine Baranski have prosthetics in the Grinch?
"At one point, because I have such an upturned nose in real life, they thought of my not wearing a prosthetic at all. But it was a little too real - I looked like a Who with a nose job.Nov 22, 2000

## Did Christine Baranski have prosthetics in the Grinch?
"At one point, because I have such an upturned nose in real life, they thought of my not wearing a prosthetic at all. But it was a little too real - I looked like a Who with a nose job.Nov 22, 2000

## What kind of shoes did Cindy Lou Who Wear?
The Karamel Corn slippers are covered in long pink and white faux fur and are the same style worn by Cindy Lou Who, played by Taylor Momsen. The slippers have bits of artificial snow from the Whoville set and include the name “Gabby” on the interior.Dec 1, 2011

## What did Cindy Lou Who Wear?
The Cindy Lou Who character in the movie, which came out in the year 2000, wears a checkered dress underneath a red cape. This is accented by red tights and black Mary Jane shoes. While a good choice for the red cape would be a Christmas tree skirt with a white trim, a cape can be easily made at home from red fabric.Sep 28, 2017

## What type of character is Cindy Lou?
In the book, she's depicted as a tiny, innocent little thing with wide eyes and a sweet pink nightgown. She's obviously quite the opposite of the Grinch, and when she approaches him, she's not out to get him. She's not even angry or mean.

## Why does Cindy Lou Who have a regular nose?
It was added in because of Momsen's age. “I was too young to wear the prosthetics so they wrote a line into the film, 'She hasn't even grown into her nose yet,'” she said. “So they just put full blush on my nose.”Dec 14, 2020
